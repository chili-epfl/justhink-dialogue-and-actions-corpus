9	103	369.461	371.221	A	i think we should go to mount zurich .
9	104	371.721	373.670	A	and then go to bern and then go to basel .
9	105	373.998	379.820	B	or we can go to mount zurich mount basel mount bern mount neuchatel mount interlaken .
9	106	380.044	386.497	A	no i think it would be better if we go to , mount zurich , and then bern .
9	107	387.116	388.224	B	i don't know .
9	108	387.169	387.669	A	we
9	109	388.467	395.331	A	or we should go mount saint gallen to mount zurich .
9	110	397.076	398.229	A	to mount
9	111	398.933	400.030	A	bern .
9	112	400.030	407.346	A	wait no to mount basel to mount to mount neuchatel to mount bern then interlaken .
9	113	407.965	409.850	B	to mount zurich ?
9	114	410.272	415.420	B	mount bern to mount neuchatel to mount basel to mount and then mount interlaken ?
9	115	415.983	418.459	B	you kind of like go there i'm not sure that could happen though .

9	120	423.720	426.195	A	so , yeah okay .
9	121	424.987	426.591	B	so it has to be a straight line .
9	122	426.985	429.876	B	or it can have zigzags but never overlap .
9	123	427.452	428.245	A	yeah

9	130	449.606	453.208	A	i don't think i've got anything you've just said bob .
9	131	459.876	461.952	B	or finish out mount bern
9	132	462.422	466.318	A	i think we should finish at mount interlaken because we started we started
9	133	466.684	468.569	A	uh mount montreux .
9	134	467.134	473.295	B	no we have to finish at mount um montreux because she wants all of them , there .
